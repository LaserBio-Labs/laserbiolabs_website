                question:"Will transit temperatures affect the performance of the products ?",
                answer:"No, as all products are shipped in dried form and are therefore insensitive to heat-induced degradation"

                question:"How should I store my products upon reception ?",
                answer:"Upon reception products should be stored according to recommendations (4°C for matrix and -20°C for calibrants and digests). See the kit brochure for specific instructions"
            },
            {
                question:"What is the product lifetime ?",
                answer:"We give our products a one-year expiration limit after they leave our facilities. However, if proper storage and handling recommendations are followed, product lifetime is much longer, up to several years<br> For products stored at -20°C after dilution in solvent, freeze/thaw cycles should be kept as short as possible"

                question:"Are there Materials Safety Data Sheets available ?",
                answer: "Yes. For non-European customers, please contact us if the MSDS has not been forwarded by the shipping service<br> MSDS are not included in intra-European shipments, please contact us to obtain one"

                question:"Can I pay for my order with a credit card?",

                question:"Can I get a quote or an invoice in a different currency?",
                answer:"No, we do not provide documents labeled in currencies other than Euros. However upon request, the corresponding amounts in non-Euro currencies can be indicated on your quote or invoice at the current exchange rate. Please contact us for specific demands"

                question:"Can I get a discount on my order?",
                answer:"LaserBio Labs' pricing policy is to offer the right price for its products and not to artificially inflate the catalog list prices in order to offer discounts as a marketing strategy. Prices are therefore not discounted. For large orders superior to 1000.00 Euros, please contact us"

//        question: 'How should I prepare the calibration standards for use?',
//        answer: 'Detailed preparation protocols are provided with each product. Generally, standards should be reconstituted with the appropriate solvent (usually water/acetonitrile with TFA) and mixed with matrix solution. We recommend preparing fresh working solutions for each analysis session.'

//        question: 'Which calibration standard should I choose for protein analysis?',
//        answer: 'For protein analysis, we recommend our Protein Calibration Standard I (5,000-25,000 Da range) which contains well-characterized proteins like insulin, cytochrome c, and myoglobin. For higher molecular weight proteins, consider our High Mass Calibration Standard (25,000-100,000 Da).'

//      {
//        question: 'Do you have standards for peptide mass fingerprinting?',
//        answer: 'Yes, our Peptide Calibration Mix (800-4,000 Da) is specifically designed for peptide mass fingerprinting applications. It contains angiotensin peptides and ACTH fragments that provide excellent calibration points in the typical peptide mass range.'
//      },
//      {
//        question: 'Can your standards be used for quantitative analysis?',
//        answer: 'While our calibration standards are primarily designed for mass calibration, some can serve as internal standards for semi-quantitative work. For accurate quantitative analysis, we recommend using isotopically labeled internal standards specific to your analytes.'
